    /// Instance Defined Procedural State Machine Handle
    /// Layer enums to be declared by the user
    ///
    /// Features/Configuration:
    /// - Any Transitions are evaluated first, followed by direct transitions
    /// - Self Transitions are explicitly ignored (skipped)
    /// - Disposal is idempotent and safe to call multiple times
    /// - Blittable and unmanaged compatible for high performance
    /// - Multi-layered support for parallel state logic
    ///
    /// Usage:
    /// - Initialize() with the number of layers
    /// - InitLayer() for each layer with the default state
    /// - Add_AnyTransition() for any transitions
    /// - Add_DirectTransition() for direct transitions
    /// - Entry() to start the FSM
    /// - TickUpdate(), TickFixedUpdate(), TickLateUpdate() to call tick logic
    /// - TryPollTransitions() to check for transitions and update the FSM
    /// - Dispose() to clean up resources
    ///
    /// Validation / Exception Handling:
    /// - Throws ArgumentException if TData is not a blittable type
    /// - Throws InvalidOperationException if Entry() is called without initialized layers
    /// - Throws InvalidOperationException if an allocated layer was never set up via InitLayer()
    /// - Throws InvalidOperationException if TryPollTransitions() is called before Entry() (Unity checks only)
    /// - Throws ArgumentException if enum types do not match the layer's initialized type
    /// - Throws ArgumentOutOfRangeException if state indices are invalid for the layer
    /// - Throws InvalidOperationException if Initialize() is called on an already active FSM
    /// </summary>
